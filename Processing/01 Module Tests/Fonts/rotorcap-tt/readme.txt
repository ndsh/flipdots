Usage:

For best results, use Photoshop 5.0 at 7 points. Set the 
tracking to 40 (regular) or 60 (bold, extended). Of course 
with anti-aliasing turned off.

Please note that I have not put as much work on the kerning 
on these fonts as you would expect from a commercial release. 
Therefore, make sure that all words you type look good, and 
manually kern those that don't for ultimate satisfaction.

If you use and/or like this font, I would be delighted if 
you told me so, and where you used it. 

This font is indeed freeware, which means that you can 
download it from the ROTORtype site and use it as much as 
you want without paying anything for it. But there are a 
couple of things you by no means have the freedom to do;

You must not redistribute the font in any way, not even the 
original archive. Spread only the link to ROTORtype, 
http://www.rotor-fabrik.com/type/. If you didn't download 
the font from that URL, please mail robot@rotor-fabrik.com 
and tell us about it. 

You must not directly make any money on it, ie. sell it, 
trade it for drugs or anything like that. If you use it in 
any commercial project, you have the freedom to do so. The 
only thing we expect (and demand) is that anyone who use this 
font tells us about it, and perhaps even gives us a more or 
less humble amount of dollars for being such nice guys.


About the font:

I made the first version of ROTORcap sometime during 
springtime 1998 in the process of redesigning the 
CAP&Design website. At that point, the small type in 
the navigation was considered too small by the client, 
but I refused to change it. And now, almost a year after 
the site was launched, I've been asked about this font 
uncountable times.

Most people have naturally asked whether the font is 
available to the public in any way, but up to this point 
it has been exclusive property of the ROTORfabrik workers. 
I expect you to be conclusive enough to realise this is 
not the case anymore, and what's even better - we will 
continue to release freetypefaces on a regular basis from 
now on.
